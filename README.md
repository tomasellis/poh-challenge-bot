# POH Challenge Bot

A [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/poh_dispute_bot) that tweets each time a profile is challenged by the members of [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) (POH). It displays the name of the profile being challenged, a link to the profile in POH and a link to the case in the [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) court.
